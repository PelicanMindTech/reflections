# Reflections prototype (Android app)

Reflections is a virtual diary for recording your daily thoughts and
sentiments. Every morning Reflections asks you a number of questions,
that will make you reflect on your mental well-being and how you can
improve it. The diary is recorded as a video.

While recording your diary entries, Reflections will measure your
sentiments using facial analysis. And, while not in the current
prototype, also semantic sentiment and voice analysis. This way,
Reflections, will provide you a timeline of how your mood have
changed during the year.

You can go back to days that were especially encouraging or
challenging, to reflect, remember and reconsider what made you feel that
way.

# The current prototype

The current prototype was written during the Junction
2020-hackathon. None of the team had any previous Android development
experience.
